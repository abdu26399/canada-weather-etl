# canada-weather-etl
I have created an End to end weather ETL for various canadian cities. Python live pulls OpenWeather data, extracts, transforms and loads the cleaned data to Azure SQL, and schedules runs with GitHub Actions. Power BI connects to the SQL table for reporting. Configurable via YAML.
